# About Us

The **GreekMyth** project is a web application that provides users with a platform to create, share, and discuss stories based on Greek mythology. The project aims to promote creativity, storytelling, and community engagement by allowing users to create and share their own stories, read stories created by others, and engage in discussions with other users.
